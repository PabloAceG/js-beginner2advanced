# Introduction

So... the content of this repo belongs to a course I found on Udemy (more 
details in 
[Disclaimer](https://github.com/PabloAceG/js-beginner2advanced#disclaimer) 
section). But, what can you find here?

```bash
.
|-- assets
|-- calculator-app
|-- classes
|-- multi
|-- smart-watch-showcase
```

- **Assets**: Images used for the projects.
- **Calculator Application**: Project on creating a webpage simulating a 
calculator, useful to familiarize with grid layouts, errors, logical operators,
etc.
- **Classes**: Notes I took from the lessons (not really organized into the 
classes themselves, more into logical blocks).
- **Multi**: Slightly more complex project, a recap of all concepts learned 
through the course. Has four "games": a emoji generator, a quiz, a media 
reproductor and a multi-step form.
- **SmartWatch Application**: Simulation of a store selling different 
SmartWatch models. Useful to change images, images superposition, iteractive
actions (intervals), etc.
